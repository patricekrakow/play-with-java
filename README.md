# Let's Play with Java

## Abstract

I would like to finally become a bit proficient writing implementation of API (endpoints) in Java. I will of course (re-)start from the "Hello, World!" program written in Java, and then we will see...

## Installation of my Java Playground

I will use the _Ubuntu Playground_ from [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/about) on which I will install the 64-Bit JDK Package for Debian-based Linux Platforms. Many thanks again to the Killercoda team to provide such environment for free!

1\. Go to <https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/ubuntu> and register if necessary.
